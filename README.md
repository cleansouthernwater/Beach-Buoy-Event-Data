# Southern Water Outfall Event Data

The dated csv files in this repository contain a record of all Southern Waters outfall events published on their self-reporting web tool, Beachbuoy: https://www.southernwater.co.uk/water-for-life/our-bathing-waters/beachbuoy

> Beachbuoy gives you near real-time information about releases of stormwater or wastewater at your favourite spot. On this interactive, online map you can see updates about releases from combined sewer overflows (CSOs), so you know what is happening near you.

Each file contains the complete set of events up to the date of the file. The data is extracted using the Robotic Process Automation tool, n8n: https://n8n.io/ The workflow is stored in the n8n.json file.
